Dream Journal
==============

Using this simple app you can keep track of your dreams.

Click `Add Dream` button and enter a short title for your dream as well as some additional data:
+ _Date and Time_ section can be used to enter your sleeping schedule. 
+ If the Dream was Lucid, choose lucidity technique - _MILD_ or _WILD_ -  you have used to keep your conciousness during the Dream, and choose _None_ if it wasn't Lucid. More on Lucidity in upcoming `Info` section of the app.
+ _Setting_ field is for you to enter location of the Dream. 

All these additional fields (more in the future) will be consolidated into statistical data in upcoming `User` section, so they can help you shape your practices towards learning Lucid Dreaming.
